# Handoff

State on 2026-10-09. Last code commit: `9e13148`, a fourth rate-confirmation
reader (§12.125). `git log` has the newest; the deploy is checked with the
curl calls under "How to run the checks".

Read `CLAUDE.md` first. Build from `docs/design-spec.md`; each feature below
names its § there.

## What is live

| Commit | What | § |
|---|---|---|
| `4ad77ae` | The zone follows the state; a two-zone state asks, and Save waits | 12.120 |
| `c43adac` | Paste an address into Street: fills street, city, state, ZIP | 12.121 |
| `6e90a91` | Baseline 7c pinned at its list position, then waits for stillness | — |
| `52452ca` | Fill a new load from a rate confirmation PDF, read in the browser | 12.122 |
| `aed14ae` | Baseline 7f re-saved with the one-line fill strip | 12.122 |
| `ccddd9b` | E2e runs say at the end whether the machine slept | — |
| `99365d0` | The board says "Not updating" when its poll has stopped | 12.123 |
| `2eba5a1` | React #418 fixed: the board hydrates as the server rendered it, in any zone and on any clock | 12.124 |
| `a89504d` | The hydration e2e runs in a browser zone the server is not in | 12.124 |
| `9e13148` | A fourth reader: Pickup # / Delivery # columns, load number beside "Arrive Order" | 12.125 |

PDF fill reads four layouts: label rows, a Stops section, PU/SO blocks,
and Pickup # / Delivery # columns. It never sends the file anywhere.

**Local samples (21 PDFs in `.samples/`, scored 2026-10-09, counts only):**
- 13 read: 1 label rows, 3 Stops section, 6 PU/SO blocks, 3 Pickup/Delivery
  columns.
- 3 scans with no text layer.
- 5 not recognised:
  - the known fourth layout (9 pages, "Route #"), waiting on Alex;
  - two form-like files;
  - two single-column files that each look different.
- Every read file filled its load number and every address field. 25 of 26
  appointment times were filled; the one missing time blocks Save until it is
  typed.

Files are numbered by name order in the counts-only scripts; no names or
values are written down anywhere.

## Rules for rate confirmations (from Alex, standing)

- Real PDFs live only in `.samples/` (git-ignored). Never commit, copy, upload,
  log or screenshot them. Tests use invented fixtures only
  (`src/test/ratecon-fixtures.ts`, `src/test/tiny-pdf.ts`).
- No report prints a rate, broker contact, phone, email or driver name.
- No real document goes to any outside service. Do not choose a vendor.
- `git ls-files | grep -iE "\.pdf|expected\.json|samples"` must print nothing.

## Open decisions, waiting on Alex

1. **Language-model reader: yes or no.** It would cover layouts and scans
   the templates miss. Proposal (2026-10-09): send only the text of the stop
   pages (scans: read with OCR in the browser first), with rates and contacts
   removed in the browser, through our server. Nothing is built, nothing has
   been sent, and no vendor is chosen.
2. **Broker confidentiality.** Rate confirmations often carry
   confidentiality clauses. These may rule out sending even redacted text to
   any vendor. This has to be answered before the vendor question matters.
3. **Vendor terms**, if the answer to 1 is yes. Researched 2026-10-09; see
   [`llm-reader-vendors.md`](llm-reader-vendors.md) (vendor defaults, may
   change, not legal advice). In short:
   - Every vendor read says no training on API data by default, except
     Mistral, which is unconfirmed.
   - Anthropic's own API has no EU processing option today.
   - AWS Bedrock stores no prompts by default, except for some models.
   - Azure, OpenAI and Google offer EU processing, each with conditions.
   - Still to read: data-processing agreements, sub-processors, what
     "flagged" means in practice, and SOC 2/ISO reports.
4. **Sentry hydration filter.** The new read token works. The Sentry project
   drops React hydration errors on arrival: its stats show "filtered
   (react-hydration-errors)". This is why #418 never showed as an issue.
   Keep the filter, or turn it off so these errors show? Not changed. The
   tracing report still waits for 10+ real sign-ins.
5. **Sleep test.** Alex runs e2e, closes the lid mid-run, and confirms the
   end-of-run line names the sleep.
6. **The "worker feeding knowledge" question**, as Alex named it on
   2026-10-09. It isn't written down in any session so far: get the question
   from Alex before doing anything with it.
7. **The 9-page "Route #" layout** (4 stops; correctly refused today): is
   "Route #" the load number; what does "Scheduling: Open" mean; can more
   samples from that broker be had? Not the same as the Pickup/Delivery
   columns reader, which is built.
8. **Stage 4 scope.** The window-order and date-range checks cover filled
   stops only. Should typed stops get them too?

## React #418: fixed

Fixed in `2eba5a1` (§12.124). The header's "YOU" clock and the dispatch
clock's title read the viewer's zone while rendering. "Not updating" compared
the server's fetch instant with the browser's clock. Both now wait until the
page has loaded.

- `src/components/console/hydration.test.tsx` renders the whole board under
  `TZ=UTC` and hydrates it in Europe/Belgrade, and again with the browser's
  clock 5 minutes behind.
- The e2e "the console hydrates without a React hydration error"
  (`e2e/console.spec.ts`) now runs in a browser zone the server is not in.
  It also matches the production wording ("Minified React error #418"). On
  the pre-fix code it fails with exactly that error.
- In Sentry: filtered hydration errors arrived nearly every day up to the
  13:00 UTC hour on 2026-10-09. None arrived after the fix went live at 14:14
  UTC (checked 16:33 UTC). At a few a day, a longer window is still worth a
  look.

## How to run the checks

```sh
npm run check            # typecheck + lint + vitest (starts the test DB on 127.0.0.1:55432)
npm run e2e              # Playwright: builds once, then runs; baselines in e2e/__screenshots__
npm run ratecon:score    # only if .samples/ exists; prints pass/fail per field per file, never values
npm run gate             # check + preflight + db:verify + e2e
```

- Test databases: `fleet_test` (vitest), `fleet_e2e`, `fleet_commit`. Never
  commit into `fleet_test`.
- Baselines: if any moves, stop and show Alex the diff before re-saving. Do
  not change the Playwright config.
- Deploy status: `gh` is not installed. Curl
  `https://api.github.com/repos/AleksandarSarbajic/vin-fleet-tracker/deployments?per_page=3`,
  then `/deployments/<id>/statuses?per_page=1`.

## Next

Nothing is in progress. Wait for Alex on the open decisions above, then work
in the order Alex picks.
