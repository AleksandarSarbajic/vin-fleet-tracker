# Handoff

State on 2026-10-13. Last code commit: `9e13148`, a fourth rate-confirmation
reader (§12.125); everything since is docs. `npm run check` passed on
2026-10-13 (157 files, 2109 tests). `git log` has the newest; the deploy is
checked with the curl calls under "How to run the checks".

Read `CLAUDE.md` first. Build from `docs/design-spec.md`; each feature below
names its § there.

## What is live

| `a89504d` | The hydration e2e runs in a browser zone the server is not in | 12.124 |
| `9e13148` | A fourth reader: Pickup # / Delivery # columns, load number beside "Arrive Order" | 12.125 |

PDF fill reads four layouts: label rows, a Stops section, PU/SO blocks,
and Pickup # / Delivery # columns. It never sends the file anywhere.

**Local samples (28 PDFs in `.samples/`, triaged 2026-10-13, counts only).**
This replaces the 21-PDF count of 2026-10-09.
- 13 read: 1 label rows, 3 Stops section, 6 PU/SO blocks, 3 Pickup/Delivery
  columns. The same 13 as on 2026-10-09; none of the new files is read.
- 3 scans with no text layer.
- 12 not recognised, all with a text layer (was 5).
- Every read file filled its load number and every address field. 25 of 26
  appointment times were filled; the one missing time blocks Save until it is
  typed (item (a), not touched). 16 of 26 stops are marked Check.
- `expected.json` (ground truth) covers only 7 of the 28: six read files, all
  passing the bar with no appointment silently wrong, and the "Route #" file,
  correctly refused. The other 21 have no ground truth, so
  `npm run ratecon:score` skips them. The 7 read files among them filled every
  field, but that is not checked against what the PDF says.
- 10 PDFs carry the date 2026-10-13, though only 7 are net new. So 3 earlier
  files were replaced or re-saved: two of the three scans and one not
  recognised file. Ask Alex whether these are the unsigned originals in (c).
  If so, the two scans still have no text layer.

**The 12 not recognised: new layouts, not old ones changed.** None has more
than one of any existing layout's `recognise` labels, and the labels it
does have are common words.

**Clustered by shared lines, 2026-10-13: 8 clusters.** For each pair of the
12 files, the number of identical distinct lines they share (trimmed,
whitespace collapsed), divided by the smaller file's distinct-line count.
Clusters are single-linkage at a ratio of **0.10** or more.

| Cluster | Size | Files | Ratios within |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 3 | #2, #4, #10 | 0.12–0.24 |
| C2 | 2 | #16, #17 | 0.66 |
| C3 | 2 | #7, #11 | 0.22 |
| C4–C8 | 1 each | #8, #9, #12 (the 9-page "Route #" file), #21, #28 | ≤ 0.05 to any file |

How 0.10 was chosen, on the 13 read files, whose layouts are known:
- Pairs from different layouts: 57 pairs, never above 0.02.
- Pairs within one layout: Stops section 0.86–0.92, Pickup/Delivery columns
  0.74–0.76. PU/SO blocks range from 0.02 to 0.83 (median 0.02).
- So 0.10 sits above every cross-layout pair. A ratio that high means the
  same source.

Caveats:
- **C1 and C3 may split.** At 0.12–0.24 they are well above the cross-layout
  ceiling but well below a clean same-layout score. That fits template
  versions from one broker as well as one layout.
- **Singletons may merge.** The metric cannot see layouts like PU/SO, where
  label and value share a line, so two files of one such layout can share
  almost no lines.
- **Best estimate:** 8 layouts, with a likely range of 7 to 10.
- **Strongest single layout:** C2, at 0.66, close to the known same-layout
  scores.

File numbers are by name order across the 28 PDFs in `.samples/` as of
2026-10-13. They shift whenever a file is added, renamed or removed, so check
the count is still 28 before using them. No names or values are written down
anywhere.

## Rules for rate confirmations (from Alex, standing)

- Real PDFs live only in `.samples/` (git-ignored). Never commit, copy, upload,
  log or screenshot them. Tests use invented fixtures only
  (`src/test/ratecon-fixtures.ts`, `src/test/tiny-pdf.ts`).
- No report prints a rate, broker contact, phone, email or driver name.
- No real document goes to any outside service. Do not choose a vendor.
- `git ls-files | grep -iE "\.pdf|expected\.json|samples"` must print nothing.

## Decided by Alex, 2026-10-13

- **Sentry hydration filter: keep it.** The Sentry config is not changed.
  (Was open decision 4.)
- **FCFS windows, question (b): yes.** A start and end more than two hours
  apart, filled as FCFS receiving hours and marked Check, is what Alex would
  enter. The rule in `design-spec.md` (Appointments, under §12.122) stays as
  it is.

## Open decisions, waiting on Alex

1. **Language-model reader: yes or no.** It would cover layouts and scans
   the templates miss. Proposal (2026-10-09): send only the text of the stop
   pages (scans: read with OCR in the browser first), with rates and contacts
   removed in the browser, through our server. Nothing is built, nothing has
   been sent, and no vendor is chosen.
2. **Broker confidentiality.** Rate confirmations often carry
   confidentiality clauses. These may rule out sending even redacted text to
   any vendor. This has to be answered before the vendor question matters.
3. **Vendor terms**, if the answer to 1 is yes. Researched 2026-10-09; see
   [`llm-reader-vendors.md`](llm-reader-vendors.md) (vendor defaults, may
   change, not legal advice). In short:
   - Every vendor read says no training on API data by default, except
     Mistral, which is unconfirmed.
   - Anthropic's own API has no EU processing option today.
   - AWS Bedrock stores no prompts by default, except for some models.
   - Azure, OpenAI and Google offer EU processing, each with conditions.
   - Still to read: data-processing agreements, sub-processors, what
     "flagged" means in practice, and SOC 2/ISO reports.
4. ~~Sentry hydration filter.~~ Decided 2026-10-13: keep it (above). The
   Sentry project drops React hydration errors on arrival, which is why #418
   never showed as an issue. The tracing report still waits for 10+ real
   sign-ins.
5. **Sleep test.** Alex runs e2e, closes the lid mid-run, and confirms the
   end-of-run line names the sleep.
6. **The "worker feeding knowledge" question**, as Alex named it on
   2026-10-09. It isn't written down in any session so far: get the question
   from Alex before doing anything with it.
7. **The 9-page "Route #" layout** (4 stops; correctly refused today): is
   "Route #" the load number; what does "Scheduling: Open" mean; can more
   samples from that broker be had? Not the same as the Pickup/Delivery
   columns reader, which is built.
8. **Stage 4 scope.** The window-order and date-range checks cover filled
   stops only. Should typed stops get them too?

## React #418: fixed

Fixed in `2eba5a1` (§12.124). The header's "YOU" clock and the dispatch
clock's title read the viewer's zone while rendering. "Not updating" compared
the server's fetch instant with the browser's clock. Both now wait until the
page has loaded.

- `src/components/console/hydration.test.tsx` renders the whole board under
  `TZ=UTC` and hydrates it in Europe/Belgrade, and again with the browser's
  clock 5 minutes behind.
- The e2e "the console hydrates without a React hydration error"
  (`e2e/console.spec.ts`) now runs in a browser zone the server is not in.
  It also matches the production wording ("Minified React error #418"). On
  the pre-fix code it fails with exactly that error.
- In Sentry: filtered hydration errors arrived nearly every day up to the
  13:00 UTC hour on 2026-10-09. None arrived after the fix went live at 14:14
  UTC (checked 16:33 UTC). At a few a day, a longer window is still worth a
  look.

## How to run the checks

```sh
npm run check            # typecheck + lint + vitest (starts the test DB on 127.0.0.1:55432)
npm run e2e              # Playwright: builds once, then runs; baselines in e2e/__screenshots__
npm run ratecon:score    # only if .samples/ exists; prints pass/fail per field per file, never values
npm run gate             # check + preflight + db:verify + e2e
```

- Test databases: `fleet_test` (vitest), `fleet_e2e`, `fleet_commit`. Never
  commit into `fleet_test`.
- Baselines: if any moves, stop and show Alex the diff before re-saving. Do
  not change the Playwright config.
- Deploy status: `gh` is not installed. Curl
  `https://api.github.com/repos/AleksandarSarbajic/vin-fleet-tracker/deployments?per_page=3`,
  then `/deployments/<id>/statuses?per_page=1`.

## Next

Nothing is in progress. Wait for Alex on the open decisions above, then work
in the order Alex picks.
